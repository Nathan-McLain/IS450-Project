Plan to Sell

 * Sell as an app online and have a one time fee to purchase the app or access to website. (Play with prices $2-4)
 * Possably have an ad free paid version and a free version with adds. Have ads on the sides of the page and one that pops up above or below every 10 questions that can be cleared after a few min.
